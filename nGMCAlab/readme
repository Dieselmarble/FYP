nGMCAlab Toolbox

The following scripts give examples of how to use the algorithms:

- example_nGMCA.m:
    for the nGMCA algorithms using sparsity in the direct domain, from article:
	Jeremy Rapin, Jerome Bobin, Anthony Larue, Jean-Luc Starck.

	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 61, issue 22, p. 5620-5632, 2013.

 - example_NMR.m:
    for the nGMCA algorithms using sparsity in transformed domain,
    on simulation of 1D NMR spectra, from article:
	Jeremy Rapin, Jerome Bobin, Anthony Larue, Jean-Luc Starck.

	SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences (accepted), 2014.

 - example_NMR.m:
    for the nGMCA algorithms using sparsity in transformed domain,
    on simulated mixtures of 2D images, from article:
	Jeremy Rapin, Jerome Bobin, Anthony Larue, Jean-Luc Starck.

The algorithms using sparsity in a transformed domain need:

    - the Wavelab Toolbox: http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ for orthonormal
    wavelets and for the choice of wavelet filters with MakeONFilter.

    - the redWave Toolbox: a specific toolbox computing 1D or 2D wavelet
    transform on any 1 or 2 dimensions of an up to 4 dimensional data.
    To set it properly, read and launch compile_and_test in the
    Libraries/redWaveToolbox folder.
