RedWave toolbox

This toolbox aims at performing 1D and 2D redundant wavelet transforms on 
on any 1 or 2 dimensions of a tensor data of up to 4 dimensions.

Compilation was tried on Mac and 32 and 64bits Windows, with g++. Parallelization
with OpenMP by uncommented #define __PARALLELIZED__ in sources/redWaveTools.hpp.
mexopts.bat also needs to be modified in order to compile with openmp
(use edit([prefdir '\mexopts.bat']) in order to quickly access it). This
can be done by linking with flag -lgomp and compiling with flag -fopenmp. See
folder examples_mexopts in order to see examples having worked on win32 and 
win64.
Parallelization may or may not speed the computation depending on the computer
settings.

Use the compile_and_test script in order to compile the functions and for 
examples of how to use them.
Once the compilation is done, add the bin folder to the path.
